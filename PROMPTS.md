## Initial Setup
- “Build Agents on Cloudflare with the Agents SDK. Show me how to set up agent.ts and index.ts with Durable Objects.”  
- “Fix the TypeScript errors in agent.ts and index.ts.”  

## Debugging
- “Why am I seeing `Property 'prompt' does not exist on type 'unknown'` in TypeScript?”  
- “Wrangler error: Durable Object not exported. How do I fix it?”  
- “Vectorize upsert error: expected 768 dimensions, got 0 — how to fix?”  

## UI / Frontend
- “Make the chatbot UI modern, appealing, and humanized with HTML/CSS.”  
- “Add a navbar with tabs: About, Project, Agent, Contact.”  
- “Add a button ‘Talk to my Agent’ that switches to the Agent tab.”  
- “Implement WebSocket auto-reconnect in app.js.”  
- “Add Clear Chat, Schedule, and Voice input buttons.”  

## Improvements
- “Turn the project into a personal portfolio showcasing my application for Cloudflare’s internship.”  
- “Show how to integrate /note and /search into the frontend.”  
- “Update README.md with project details, internship context, and demo link.”
